Grandmaster "Good, because time is of the essence. The assassin should've already infiltrated the hotel."
Morgan "And I imagine Graham is making his move too?"
Grandmaster "Indeed, I have him on radar. It won't take long for him to arrive."

# ''Grandmaster's narration:'' You made a terrible judgment call, Morgan. By attracting undue attention to yourself, you've ensured that you'll be arrested and charged for impersonating a Federal officer. As for Adam Rourke, he was assassinated, but the assassin did a sloppy enough job to get arrested as well. An incredibly boring and anti-climactic way to end things. I'm disappointed.

You really should've remembered the first lesson I ever taught you: never pick a fight you can't win. Of course, Graham didn't heed the lesson either. After knocking you out, he tried to face off against the assassin directly, and they both killed each other. Do better next time.

Man "Hey, who the hell are you? This room's closed!"
Agent Graham "Not anymore."
Female voice "I've infiltrated the conference room. Looking for a disguise now."
Morgan Looks like the assassin's a woman, and she's pretty close to getting ready for the job. I need to make my way to the location ASAP. But first, let me just hack Graham's phone.
Morgan The encryption on his phone's real strong, so I doubt I could trace it, but I can still call him if I decide to side with him.

Sarah "If he managed to get the drop on us, he could get the drop on June too. I need to call her."
Morgan "Looks like my hunch was right."
Sarah "We need to get to the Davidson Solutions headquarters, ASAP!"
Agent Graham "Tch. Looks like I underestimated you two. But it doesn't matter. I'll bring everyone to justice all"
Agent Graham "at once!"
Morgan This is it, the moment where I finally take Agent Graham down. And knowing who I am now, this is what I'll do.

Morgan My future with Sarah is all I care about now, and this asshole's in the way! He will die tonight!
Morgan Agent Graham may have cut through June's footsoldiers with ease, but they weren't masters of time like I am. There's no move of his I can't foresee. No tactic of his I can't outmatch.
Morgan "Time to die, Graham! This is for Sarah!"
Sarah "Goodbye, you sanctimonious old man. You won't be missed."
Morgan "We did it...oh my God we did it, Sarah! We won!"
Sarah "That's right! We won, my love! The world is ours!"
Female voice "You two did win. A shame I can't say that for myself."
Sarah "Huh? What are you talking about, June? Graham's dead, we're in the clear."
June "It's the burdens of leadership, Sarah. I tried a gamble to get Graham out of hiding, and it let him"
June "straight to my headquarters. You were just a pawn in my plans, so nobody will care what happens to"
June "you. But as for me? You'll find that my clients are rather...unforgiving."
Sarah "What? No, June, NO!"
June "Let this be a lesson to you both. If you play with fire...you're going to get burned. I made"
June "promises I couldn't keep, and this is the result..."
# ''Sarah:'' //(Crying)// "I'm sorry, June! I'm sorry I couldn't protect you! I promise I'll make it right!"
# ''June:'' //(Coughing)// "Don't repeat my mistakes June...don't make a promise you can't keep...I've used you for my ambitions all your life, sweet child...but now you need to live for yourself...find a new life..."
Morgan "I'll protect her, June. I'll stay with her no matter what. You can rest easy now, okay?"
June "Thank you, Morgan...please...make Sarah happy...she deserves to be rewarded...for serving me so"
June "well..."
Morgan It's heartbreaking to see Sarah's career culminate in such a tragedy. Perhaps things were always going to end this way. But she still got a chance to say goodbye. And she still has me to lean on. I will protect her, no matter what. She won't meet the same end as her master. We're both going to get our happy endings, whatever it takes.

Morgan "I must say, you have excellent taste in beachfront property."
# ''Sarah:'' //(snuggles up to Morgan)// "Why thank you! I'm glad you finally listened to my infinite wisdom and stopped insisting on renting stuff all the time. We're filthy rich and we should act like it!"
Morgan "I couldn't agree with you more, my love. You've truly made me see the light."
Morgan And, of course, our vibrant event planning business keeps the coffers full even when assassination work dries up. I really underestimated the benefits of having a "legitimate business" as a cover.
Sarah "As much as murder remains my number one passion, I have come to enjoy providing the people a good"
Sarah "time every now and then."
Morgan "So have I. People deserve to have a chance to let loose every now and then. After all, who knows"
Morgan "when a fun vacation" //(Smirks deviously)//"might become your last."
Morgan And with that, June Davidson is avenged. It took a great deal of patience for the two of us to discover the identities of the five LambdaCorp executives who ordered her death, but it was all worth it. June's killers walked right into our luxurious trap, and now their bodies will be cleaned out with no one the wiser.
Sarah "Some dishes really are best served cold, aren't they?"
Morgan "Indeed they are." //(Kisses Sarah)// "And some dishes are best sampled...in private."
Sarah "Lead the way, darling."

Morgan I need to be careful with Graham. The Grandmaster might want to interrogate him and find out everything he knows.
Morgan That's right, I'll wear him down bit by bit. Sooner or later, he'll slip up...
Morgan And I'll capture him!
Morgan "You're mine now, Graham. No sudden moves!"
Graham "You really think you can take me alive? You think those two ladies will let you?!"
Morgan "You're not a threat anymore. Time to meet the Grandmaster, asshole."
Female voice "No, you can't!"
Morgan "What are you doing, June? I'm on your side!"
June "If you're on my side, you'll hand over Graham, right now!"
Morgan "Huh? But why? I need to deliver her to my master!"
Sarah "Do what June says, Morgan."
Morgan "What the hell?! I can't just betray the-"
June "Screw the Grandmaster! You already know she doesn't care what you do! Taking Graham to her's a"
June "waste of time, but if you hand him over to me, I can still fix-"
Sarah "June?! No! NOOO!"
Graham "Looks like she was doomed from the very beginning, huh?"
Morgan "Doomed? What are you talking about?"
Graham "Dear old June Davidson signed her own death warrant the moment I broke into this building. She's"
Graham "the one who went maverick and dragged me into this case to kill two birds with one stone, and look"
Graham "how that ended up for her."
Sarah "Are you saying June brought this on herself?"
Graham "Yup. She was only hired to kill Adam Roarke, nothing more. But she decided to get clever and use"
Graham "you for the job, knowing that it'd bring me out of hiding too. Adam and I are both...connected, you"
Graham "see, and she thought she'd get a nice bonus by delivering both of our heads. Once everything went"
Graham "to shit, she probably wanted to capture me alive as a last-ditch Hail Mary. Clearly, she was"
Graham "mistaken."
Sarah "And that means I have no reason to keep you alive."
Morgan Killing Graham did nothing to soften Sarah's pain. I could see she was still broken, that perhaps she always would be. But still, we'd been through so much together. I didn't want things to end like this.
Morgan "Sarah..."
Sarah "You need to leave, Morgan. Now."
Morgan "But..."
Sarah "I know this wasn't your fault. I know that. But I'm still angry, and I need to take it out on"
Sarah "someone. Please don't let it be you, Morgan. Go away, for your own sake."
Morgan And so I listen to her, and run. My mission is over, and so is my partnership with Sarah. It's time to go back to being an Enforcer, and wait for the Grandmaster's next orders.

Morgan Life has a way of surprising you. I never thought I'd see Sarah again after our messy journey together, but I guess it must be a small world after all.
Sarah "Morgan? What are you doing here?"
Morgan "Just another heist for the Grandmaster, stealing some intel on a planned merger between LambdaCorp"
Morgan "and HelixTech. What about you?"
# ''Sarah:'' //(holsters gun)// "I'm here on my own time. Trying to get some leads on who killed June. LambdaCorp is a name that kept coming up in my research, so that's why I'm here."
Morgan "I see. Well, I don't know if it'll help, but I could beam over a copy of the merger data I just"
Morgan "swiped, in case you want to take a look at it."
Sarah "Wait, seriously? And the Grandmaster will just let you do that?"
Morgan "What can I say? She gives her Enforcers a lot of discretionary power."
Sarah "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were taking me for a ride...but we have been through a lot"
Sarah "together, haven't we?"
Morgan "Yeah, we have."
# ''Sarah:'' //(Smiles wistfully)// "Tell you what, you beam over the data, and I'll give you a map of my infiltration route. I've cleaned out all the security on the way, so you'll have no problem making your exit."
Morgan "Really? That'd be a big help, Sarah. You've got yourself a deal."
Morgan "I guess I'll see you around, partner."
Sarah "Until next time, then. Don't be a stranger."
