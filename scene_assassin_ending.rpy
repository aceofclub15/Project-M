    Morgan "Doomed? What are you talking about?"

    Graham "Dear old June Davidson signed her own death warrant the moment I broke into this building."
    Graham "She's the one who went maverick and dragged me into this case to kill two birds with one stone, and look how that ended up for her."

    Sarah "Are you saying June brought this on herself?"

    Graham "Yup. She was only hired to kill Adam Roarke, nothing more."
    Graham "But she decided to get clever and use you for the job, knowing that it'd bring me out of hiding too."
    Graham "Adam and I are both... connected, you see, and she thought she'd get a nice bonus by delivering both of our heads."
